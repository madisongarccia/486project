<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Food affordability in the Unites States has reached an all-time high in recent years, and is a struggle that many individuals and families are no stranger to. This is a critical issue for single mothers in particular, as it impacts their household's stability, health, and overall quality of life. In California especially, the average cost of living remains just barely achievable for many and women-headed households face unique economic challenges because of it. The ability to understand and predict the median income of women-headed households in California can provide valuable insights into financial realities, and help identify common trends.</p>
<h2 id="aim-of-this-report">Aim of this Report</h2>
<p>This report aims to understand if food affordability and socioeconomic factors are accurate tools in predicting the median income of women-headed households in California. By looking at data that includes information on food costs, regional demographics and economic indicators, this analysis seeks to accomplish the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand the relationship between income and food affordability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop predictive machine learning models on median income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address how these insights can influence policy changes and improve economic outcomes in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
<p>To fully understand the important factors that may influence median income, we must first look at the raw data. This section gives an overview of the key variables by identifying relevant distributions and variations within the data. These summary statistics act as a foundation for deciding what potential predictors of median incme could be.</p>
<p>The dataset includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>race_eth_name</code> (string) Name of race/ethnic group</li>
<li><code>geotype</code> (string) Type of geographic unit place (PL), county (CO), region (RE), state (CA)</li>
<li><code>geoname</code> (string) Name of geographic unit</li>
<li><code>county_name</code> (string) Name of county the geotype is in</li>
<li><code>region_code</code> (string) Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)- based region code</li>
<li><code>cost_yr</code> (numeric) Annual food costs</li>
<li><code>median_income</code> (numeric) Median household income</li>
<li><code>affordability_ratio</code> (numeric) Ratio of food cost to household income</li>
<li><code>LL95_affordability_ratio</code> (numeric) Lower limit of affordability 95% confidence interval</li>
<li><code>UL95_affordability_ratio</code> (numeric) Upper limit of affordability confidence interval</li>
<li><code>rse_food_afford</code> (numeric) Relative standard error of affordability ratio</li>
<li><code>CA_RR_Affordability</code> (numeric) Ratio of affordability rate to California affordability rate</li>
<li><code>ave_fam_size</code> (numeric) Average family size - combined by race</li>
</ul>
<p>With the variables defined above, the next step is to delve into the statistical properties of each, which includes their underlying distributions and variations. It is important to be aware of any potential outliers or missing data before selecting predictive features for future models.</p>

<p><em>Table 2: Numeric Data Summary Satistics</em></p>
<p>Tables 2.1 and 2.2 act as a good baseline, but sometimes it can be easier to understand relationships with graphs. Below is a correlation matrix that depicts the strength of correlations between features.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/Users/madisonwozniak/Desktop/STAT486/final_project/code/correlation_matrix.png" alt="Correlation Matrix" style="width:75%; height:600px;">
    <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 1: Correlation Matrix for Numeric Features</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It can be noted from the matrix that there is a strong, almost perfect correlation between several variables. This is expected because many variables such as <code>UL96_affordability_ratio</code>, <code>LL95_affordability_ratio</code>, <code>se_food_afford</code>, <code>rse_food_afford</code>, <code>CA_RR_Affordability</code> and <code>affordability_per_person</code>are all calculated from information taken from <code>affordability_ratio</code>. Some more interesting strong correlations to take note of are between <code>cost_yr</code> and <code>ave_fam_size</code>, <code>med_income</code> and <code>food_afford_decile</code>. This is helpful because we can expect <code>food_afford_decile</code> to be an important feature in the model building process.</p>
<p>While not overwhelmingly apparent in the correlation matrix, there is also an important relationship between <code>median_income</code> and <code>ave_fam_size</code> that Figure 2 below illustrates.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">

    <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 2: Scatterplot of Income Against Family Size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 2 reveals a particularly interesting trend: while the spread of the points seems to suggest that most women-headed households earn enough to afford food for their families, the red line superimposed on the graph highlights the unfortunate reality. The median annual income in this dataset is $33,103.00. This is significantly below the median annual household income in the United States which stood at <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-282.html">$80,610.00 as of 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Although a majority of the data in this report is numeric, there are some categorical features that can still be examined. Table 3 below includes some summary statistics on these features.</p>

<p><em>Table 3: Categorical Data Summary Satistics</em></p>
<h2 id="eda-key-findings">EDA Key Findings</h2>
<p>The Exploratory Data Analysis presented in this section was useful to begin understanding basic structures, patterns, and relationships within this dataset. The following is a brief summary of the most important EDA insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many variables are calculated from the <code>affordability_ratio</code> feature - leading to high correlations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a strong positive correlation between <code>med_income</code> and <code>food_afford_decile</code> which may be relevant in the feature selection process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This data contains a wide range of annual income ($2,500 - $250,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>med_income</code> feature is highly skewed, indicating a log transformation may be necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These key findings from the EDA uphold that there is a complex relationship between income, family size, and food afforability among women-headed households in California. Moving forward, these insights will act as a foundation for finding a predictive model that best estimates median income based on economic and demographic factors.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<h2 id="feature-engineering">Feature Engineering</h2>
<p>Effective feature engineering for this dataset includes transforming the raw data obtained into meaningful, usable representations that can be fed into a model for accurate predictions. This section will identify the steps taken to engineer features effectively - specifically the process of enhancing relationships between income, household demographics, and food affordability.</p>
<p><strong>1. Add Latitude and Longitude</strong></p>
<p>The original dataset used for this report did not include coordinate information, but it can be helpful to include these features to visualize the regions this exploration focuses on. To gather this information, I imported a csv file from GitHub that contains all of the major counties, zipcodes, and coordinates in California. Using a list of counties in the original data, I mapped those names to the counties in the csv file and merged their corresponding latitude and longitude values.</p>
<p><strong>2. Food Cost Index</strong></p>
<p>The Food Cost Index is a measurement from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) used to understand the yearly costs of food in the United States. To assess where the women in this dataset stand in regards to the national average, the <code>food_cost_index</code> variable was calculated by dividing <code>cost_yr</code> by the national average cost of food. This value was calculated by averaging the median cost of food for high, medium, and low income households. (<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-prices-and-spending/">national average source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>3. Affordability Status</strong></p>
<p>Understanding if food is affordable is a useful binary indicator that is implemented by calculating if the <code>affordability_ratio</code> is above 1 (easily affordable).</p>
<p><strong>4. Affordability per Person</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>affordability_per_person</code> (numeric) Affordability ratio relative to family size</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preprocessing">Preprocessing</h3>
<p><strong>4. Handling Categorical Features</strong></p>
<p>All categorical features must be encoded into numeric formats that the computer can process when using modelling techniques. To do so, the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html"><code>OneHotEncoder</code></a> package from the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/"><code>sklearn</code></a> module is imported and fit to the predictors after they have been split into training and testing sets. This encoder works by creating binary columns for every unique category in all the categorical features contained in the data.</p>
<p><strong>5. Handling Numeric Features</strong></p>
<p>Similarly to the categorical features, numeric features also need some preprocessing before getting passed into relevant models. Since this analysis deals with features that are likely very skewed, the predictors need to be scaled using the <code>StandardScaler</code> package also from <code>sklearn</code>. The target <code>med_income</code> is also understood to be skewed, so taking the log of both the train and test target samples is a useful step to take for improved model interpretability.</p>
<p><strong>6. Handling Missing Values</strong></p>
<p>Referring back to Tables 2.1, 2.2, and 3, there are a handful of missing values that need to be handled before running any models. Using Scikit-Learn's <code>SimpleImputer</code> package, the missing numeric values can be filled with the average value of the given feature, and the most frequent value can be filled in categorical features.</p>

<h2 id="notable-patterns-across-models">Notable Patterns Across Models</h2>
<p><strong>1. Tree-Based Models Outperform Linear Models</strong></p>
<p>As recorded in Table 5, the  Decision Tree and XGBoost models outperformed Ridge Regression - indicating that there likely is not a strong linear relationship between the features.</p>
<p><strong>2. Single Model Vs. Ensemble Method</strong></p>
<p>While both the Decision Trees and XGBoost performed well, XGBoost's built-in regularization made it robust to overfitting, and more accurate. The DNN was flexible and handled the patterns in the data well, but it failed to outperform XGBoost, indicating that it may not be complex enough. While more layers and complexity could be added to this model, it is currently more computationally expensive than XGBoost, and adding more dimensions would only add to this time disparity.</p>
<h1 id="detailed-discussion-on-best-model">Detailed Discussion on Best Model</h1>
<p>After weighing all of the benefits and disadvantages of each of the models explored, the XGBoost model has proven to be the <em>best</em> based on its rMSE score, total time, and inherent ability to generalize well to new data.</p>
<h2 id="xgboost-hyperparameter-tuning">XGBoost Hyperparameter Tuning</h2>
<p>To build the most optimized version of the XGBoost Regressor, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using the grid search approach. The goal of this method was to provide many possible combinations of hyperparameters and identify the ones that minimize the model's prediction error on the training data, while also balancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. The follow hyperparameters were tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>n_estimators</code>: Controls the number of trees in the model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>learning_rate</code>: Controls the step size for updating model weights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>max_depth</code>: Specify the maximum depth of a tree</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>subsample</code>: Fraction of observations randomly sampled for each tree</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With these hyperparameter options, <code>GridSearchCV</code> tested all combinations, evaluated using 5-fold cross validation, which splits the data into 4 training subsets and one validation.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7],
    'subsample': [0.8, 1.0],
}
gb_grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    XGBRegressor(random_state=42),
    param_grid=param_grid,
    scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',
    cv=5,
    verbose = 1
)
gb_grid_search.fit(X_train_processed, y_train_log)

gb_grid_search.best_params_   #return the best parameters

</div></code></pre>
<p>This tuning process was effective in ensuring that the model was fit properly, and contained hyperparameters that control the model's over/under-fitting tendencies.</p>
<h2 id="shap-for-feature-importance">SHAP for Feature Importance</h2>
<p>Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values are a strong tool that can help interpret the information generated from the XGBoost Regressor's predictions. They act as a general framework that can be appplied to models, and explain their outputs by uniformly quantifying feature contributions.</p>
<p><strong>I. Model Performance Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>One thing SHAP can be used for is to see how predicted values compare to actual values to evaluate model performance. From these comparisons, we can gather examples of true positives/negatives and false positives/negatives from the model's output.</p>
<ol>
<li>True Positives/Negatives (TP/TN):</li>
</ol>
<p>A predicted log income value of 10.5464 compared to the actual value of 10.54639 has an error of -0.00006 which is insignificant at the chosen 0.00001 level, thus suggesting that the model is accurate in this instance.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>False Positives/Negatives (FP/FN):</li>
</ol>
<p>A predicted log income value of 10.914 compared to the actual value of 10.9404 has an error of 0.026469 which is significant at the chosen 0.00001 level. Since the model incorrectly classified this observation higher than the actual income, this is a False Positive overprediction. An opposite instance with negative error would represent a false negative underprediction.</p>
<p><strong>II. Feature Contributions</strong></p>
<p>To continue interpreting the XGBoost model predictions, SHAP can be used to quanitfy and visualize feature contributions. This can be done on a global scale, identifying the most influential features across the dataset, and locally to visualize individual predictions.</p>
<p>A SHAP summary plot helps to identify features by ranking them based on their average absolute SHAP values.</p>

    <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 3: SHAP Global Feature Contributions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The feature <code>affordability_per_person</code> is a substantially influential variable in the model as it reduces <code>median_income</code> when <code>affordability_per_person</code> is high. This suggests that higher food affordability is associated with lower income predictions. This counterintuitive relationship may seem incorrect or opposite of what we would expect, however figure 2 serves as a reminder that there is likely an external factors influencing affordability versus income. One possible explanation could be that those with lower incomes and larger families tend to shop for cheaper food options.</p>

    <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 4: SHAP Local Feature Contributions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the figure above, <code>affordability_per_person</code> contributes -1.09 to  <code>median_income</code>, pushing the prediction lower than the baseline expected prediction of 10.47. <code>affordability_ratio</code> contributes -1.496, also pulling the prediction lower. Note that I had to take the log of price so in regular terms it is $35544.79</p>

<h2 id="anomaly-detection">Anomaly Detection</h2>
<p>The next step in understanding the data and chosen model is to find observations or patterns that deviate significantly from the norm. This may include underpredictions, overpredictions, or unexpected feature combinations.</p>
<p><strong>I. Anomaly Detection on Income</strong></p>
<p>By grouping different income levels into multiple (3) clusters, we can begin to understand general patterns in the feature.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/Users/madisonwozniak/Desktop/STAT486/final_project/plots/first_anomaly.png" alt="Description" style="width:70%; height:500px;">
    <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 5</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The anomalies in income represented in figure 5 are those in red, classified as being in the top 1% of data points. These points have the furthest distances from their cluster centroid, indicating these individuals likely have unusually high incomes.</p>
<p><strong>II. Anomaly Detection on Income, Family Size, and Ethnic Group</strong></p>
<p>Looking at both numeric and categorical features with anomaly dtection can give a more holistic view of the data.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/Users/madisonwozniak/Desktop/STAT486/final_project/plots/anomaly_2.png" alt="Description" style="width:70%; height:500px;">
    <figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Figure 6</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cluster groups are close together, but a relationship to ethnic group is clearly identifiable when the data points are colored by that. The anomalies in this figure are any that appear far from their cluster centroids, these could be high or low earners clustered in a prodominently low or high income group. With this method of cluster analysis, we can analyze subgroups.</p>
<h2 id="dimension-reduction">Dimension Reduction</h2>
<p>The topic used to understand this dataset is dimension reduction. This step is included to simplify the complexity of the data, making it easier to analyze. Since some of the features in this dataset were One-Hot Encoded, it has high dimensionality from the numerous binary features. This section will focus on applying Principle COmponent ANalysis (PCA) and tSNE to transform the data.</p>
